# ProtectMyTreasure

A Discord Moderation bot I worked on in my free time. Discontinued because I had been focusing on actively developing and maintaining another Discord bot for a community at the time.

## Setup
- `npm install`
- Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`
- Pass your bot token to the `TOKEN` environment variable and run it
